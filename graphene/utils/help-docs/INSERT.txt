INSERT command
    Inserts a node/relation into the database
    INSERT NODE
        Can insert multiple nodes of any type.
        
        INSERT NODE TypeName(prop1, prop2), OtherTypeName(prop1, prop2, prop3), ...
    
    INSERT RELATION
        Adding properties to relation is like with nodes, but use queries to 
        determine which nodes to attach to. 
        Queries work exactly like MATCH queries, except you can't use type 
        name aliases

        INSERT RELATION TypeName(query)-[RELATION_NAME(prop1, prop2)]->TypeName(query)
